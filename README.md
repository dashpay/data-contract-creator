# Dash Platform Data Contract Creator
There are two apps here: original and openai. Both are meant to help users create and edit Dash Platform data contracts. Additionally, the data contracts are validated again Dash Platform Protocol, so users can save money by validating before submitting to Dash Platform. Both are web applications built in Rust using the Yew framework and WebAssembly.

## openai
Utilizes OpenAI API to generate schema based on user prompts.

## original
Utilizes a dynamic form to generate schema and supports importing of schemas.
